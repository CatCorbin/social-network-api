## Usage

Given a social network API, when I enter the command to invoke the application my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.
When I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts the data for each of these routes is displayed in formatted JSON.
When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.
When I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
